  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p>This course teaches students fundamental algorithms for 2D  and 3D computer graphics. The course introduces the OpenGL API that is used in the programming assignments. Then it discusses the graphics pipeline, 2D/3D transformations, hierarchical transformations, viewing transformations, rasterization, shading,  texture mapping, and programmable shaders. The course proceeds with algorithms and techniques for curve and shape modeling, including parametric, polygonal, and subdivision modeling. It then covers image processing and advanced rendering techniques, such as ray tracing, shadow mapping, and anti-aliasing. It concludes with animation techniques including keyframing,  motion capture, character rigging and skinning, forward and inverse kinematics, and physically-based animation.
  <p>Students are required to complete 5 programming assignments  in Java.  There is also a final exam. <br>
  <!--To receive 400-level credit, students will also need to work on a course project and meet with the instructor to discuss it.</p> !-->
  <p>The course has the  following prerequisites: &nbsp;(a) COMPSCI 187  [or equivalent, such as ECE 242)] (b) INFO 150 -or-&nbsp;MATH  235 -or-&nbsp;COMPSCI  240 [or equivalent courses from other departments]. The course offers 3 credits. </p>
<!--  <p><strong>Honor's Colloquium (373HH):</strong> Students will learn about advanced computer graphics techniques for automatic analysis, manipulation and synthesis of 3D content (shapes, scenes, textures, animations). Activities include discussions with the instructor, paper readings, and a scall-scale research project involving the implementation of a 3D virtual/augmented reality application, game engine, a user interface for 3D modeling, or   a machine learning algorithm for automatic analysis and synthesis of 3D models and animations. </p>-->

  Accommodation Statement</h2>
The University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to providing an   equal educational opportunity for all students.&nbsp; If you have a   documented physical, psychological, or learning disability on file with   Disability Services (DS), you may be eligible for reasonable academic   accommodations to help you succeed in this course.&nbsp; If you have a   documented disability that requires an accommodation, please notify me   within the first two weeks of the semester so that we may make   appropriate arrangements.</p>
  <h2>Academic Honesty Statement</h2>
    Since the integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of   higher education requires honesty in scholarship and research, academic   honesty is required of all students at the University of Massachusetts   Amherst. &nbsp;Academic dishonesty is prohibited in all programs of the   University. &nbsp;Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to:   cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and facilitating dishonesty.   &nbsp;Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on any student who has committed   an act of academic dishonesty. &nbsp;Instructors should take reasonable steps   to address academic misconduct. &nbsp;Any person who has reason to believe   that a student has committed academic dishonesty should bring such   information to the attention of the appropriate course instructor as   soon as possible. &nbsp;Instances of academic dishonesty not related to a   specific course should be brought to the attention of the appropriate   department Head or Chair. &nbsp;Since students are expected to be familiar   with this policy and the commonly accepted standards of academic   integrity, ignorance of such standards is not normally sufficient   evidence of lack of intent (<a href="http://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct/acadhonesty/">http://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct/acadhonesty/</a>).<br>
