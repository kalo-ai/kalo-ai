  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p>This course teaches students fundamental algorithms for 2D  and 3D computer graphics. First, the course introduces the OpenGL API that is used in the programming assignments. Then it covers 2D raster graphics, 2D transformations, 3D transformations, hierarchical modeling, and geometric representations of curves and shapes that are necessary to create 3D content.  The course proceeds with algorithms for lighting, reflection, shading, texture mapping and ray tracing to generate images of  3D scenes with visual realism. Then the course covers  animation techniques: keyframing,  motion capture, character rigging and skinning, physics-based simulation. Finally, topics in image processing and typography are discussed.   
  <p>Students complete 4 programming assignments  in Java. To gain 400-level credit, students also complete a  project, such as implementing  an interactive 3D game or modeling technique.  There is also a final exam.   
  <p>The course has the  following prerequisites: &nbsp;(a) CMPSCI 187  [or equivalent, such as ECE 242)] (b) CMPSCI 190DM -or-&nbsp;MATH  235 [or equivalent courses from other departments]. The course offers 3 credits, and belongs to the Robotics, Vision and Graphics track of the CS program. </p>
