  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p>Geometric modeling  is fundamental to create content for virtual worlds, computer games,  computer-animated films, computer-aided design, architecture, multimedia and  other related fields. This course will teach students the basics of 3D  geometric modeling. It will start by covering the most commonly used digital  representations of shapes, such as polygon meshes, point clouds, NURBS  surfaces, and subdivision surfaces.   The course will cover the basics of surface parametrization, texturing, de-noising, reconstruction, re-meshing, simplification, shape segmentation, classification and retrieval. The course will  proceed with an overview of techniques for  shape deformations and interactive shape modeling. There will be particular focus on techniques for sketch-based modeling, data-driven modeling, digital sculting, and procedural modeling. <br>
    <br>
    This course counts as a CS Elective toward the CMPSCI major (BA/BS). 3 credits. It also belongs to the computer graphics, vision, robotics track.<br>
    <br>

  <p></p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
  <li> Complete five programming assignments that involve implementation of geometry processing and modeling techniques.
  <li>Research paper presentation<li>Read all readings for each session before the class meetings.<li>      Class participation and discussions.<br>  
<h2>Marking scheme</h2>
  <p>Assignment 1: assemly-based modeling interface - 20%<br>
    Assignment 2: surface reconstruction - 15%<br>
    Assignment 3: differential geometry - 20% <br>
    Assignment 4: shape/part retrieval and matching - 15% <br>
    Assignment 5: surface smoothing and feature-preserving reconstruction - 20% <br>
  Class presentation and participation - 10 %<br>
  <br>
  Late policy: -10% of the final mark for every day you delay the submission.  <br>
  <br>
    This course counts as a CS Elective toward the CMPSCI major (BA/BS). 3 credits.  It also belongs to the computer graphics, vision, robotics track.<br>
    <br>
    MSc/PhD students have the option to work on a research project instead of the last 3 assignments. In this case, the marking scheme is the following: project determines 55% of the grade, Assignment 1 worths 20%, Assignment 2 worths 15%, and paper presentation worths 10%. The research project must be related to the course and should result in reasonably good results. It should be first discussed and approved by the instructor during the first 6 weeks of the course.  Projects can be done in groups (maximum 2 people). <br>
  </p>  
<h2>  Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>Prerequisites for undergraduate students: CMPSCI 240 (Reasoning under uncertainty) and CMPSCI 311 (Theory of Algorithms). <br>
  There are no prerequisites for CMPSCI graduate students, although familiarity with computer graphics is useful (as covered in CMPSCI 473). <br>
  Permission of instructor for non-CMPSCI graduate students. </p>
